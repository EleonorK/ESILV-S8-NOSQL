# ESILV-S8-NOSQL

Project README for NoSQL Group Project

This project is a group effort consisting of three members, focused on working with four different
NoSQL databases: Cassandra, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Neo4j.
The objective of the project is to complete a series of tasks using a JSON file provided at the beginning of the year.

The tasks are structured as follows for each database:

  - Installation: Each member of the group is responsible for installing the database on their machine.
  - Importing JSON data: The provided JSON data must be imported into the database.
  - Basic queries: Six simple queries must be executed on the database.
  - Complex queries: Two complex queries must be executed on the database.
  - Hard queries: One difficult query must be executed on the database.

Each member of the group will be responsible for completing the above tasks for one of the databases.
The final submission will consist of a report that outlines the process followed by each member for their respective database.

The project is intended to provide practical experience with different NoSQL databases and query languages.
The project will also help the group members to improve their collaborative skills and ability to work effectively in a team.
